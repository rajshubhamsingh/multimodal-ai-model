# Multimodal AI Caption Matcher

A streamlined Python application that leverages OpenAI’s CLIP model to match images with the most relevant captions using cosine similarity.

##  Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **multimodal AI model**—a system that seamlessly processes and correlates both visual and textual data inputs. The tool takes an image (e.g., a steaming cup of tea), compares it against a curated list of captions (70+ options), and returns the top 5 best-matched captions. Built using Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face’s `transformers`, it’s an accessible introduction to vision-language models.

##  Features

- **Image processing** using PIL and `CLIPProcessor`
- **Feature extraction** via `CLIPModel`
- **Similarity matching** using cosine similarity metrics
- **Top-N results** highlighting the most relevant captions
- Ideal for applications like:  
  - Smart social media caption generators  
  - Visual product recommendation engines  
  - AI agents capable of “seeing and speaking”
